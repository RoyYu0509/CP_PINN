**CP4PINN** is a framework for **conformal prediction**, a distribution-free conformal calibration method designed to quantify uncertainty in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs).

Each Jupyter notebook in this repository corresponds to a numerical experiment presented in the paper.
Use Python 3.10.17.
